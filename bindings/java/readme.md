# Java Binding
This is minimal Java API created especially for:
https://github.com/Detea/PekaEDS_Java
to support the new sprite format and so on.

If you launch the game normally, the java binding is completely ingored, there's no loaded JVM and so on.
All the JVM-related code is used if and only if you use the binding.
