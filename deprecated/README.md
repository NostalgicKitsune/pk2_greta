# About
I've created this directory for keeping old Pekka Kana files which are completely unused now 
and I don't want to delete them completely because they have historical value, like the source code of the legacy editor or/and they may be rewritten to modern versions like the obsolete PGl renderer.

PGL renderer is unused since the first Greta Snapshot because it uses ancient Opengl 140 which is completely obsolete. Some modern systems such as MacOS and some modern GPUs do not even support it.
It needs to be rewritten to use modern OpnenGL (4.5) or Vulcan API in the future.
